# Liquid Creative Web Developer Technical Interview

#### Your task for this test will be to build a small website based on the design given to you. This shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete. Whether or not you pass will depend on a couple of factors like:

* How closely your site resembles the design.
* How cleanly formatted your code is.
* The completion of all tasks given to you.

#### To get started with the test, you need to download the ZIP file to your computer. All of the files and assets you need are included. You should build this project using VS Code. If we can't run your project within VS Code, we can't see if you qualify for the position. After you complete the test, upload your project to a new public repository. Follow the design below, and contact Ryan Spears(rspears@liquid-creative.com) when you are finished with the link to the new public repository you uploaded your project folder to.

## Things to keep in mind:
* If you are caught stealing code from somewhere else, you will no longer be considered for this position. This test is to evaluate your own talent as a web developer.
* It is highly recommended that you use TailwindCSS in this test. You can utilize their CDN from [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn).
* You do not have to include the arrow icons on the "READ MORE" buttons on the home page. Also, any blue background color will be fine.
* The logo in the header should link back to the home page.
* The nav buttons in the header should link to their respective pages.
* Taking too long to complete this test could allow for someone else to get an offer before you. This test shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete.
* Do not add in your own design ideas. Stick to the design that you have been given.

### Be sure to reach out as soon as you finish the test so we can review your work. Good luck, and we look forward to working with you.
