# Liquid Creative Web Developer Technical Interview

#### Your task for this test will be to build a small website based on the design given to you. This shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete. Whether or not you pass will depend on a couple of factors like:

* How closely your site resembles the design.
* How cleanly formatted your code is.
* The completion of all tasks given to you.

#### To get started with the test, you need to download the ZIP file to your computer. All of the files and assets you need are included. Follow the design below, and contact Ryan Spears(rspears@liquid-creative.com) when you are finished.
